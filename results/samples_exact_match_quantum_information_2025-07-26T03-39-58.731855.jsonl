It is defined as:\n   \\[\n   I(A:C|B) = S(A|B) + S(C|B) - S(A,C|B)\n   \\]\n   where \\( S(X|Y) \\) is the conditional entropy of \\( X \\) given \\( Y \\).\n\n2. **Trace Distance and Channels**: The condition \\( || R[\\rho_{BC}] - \\rho_{ABC} ||_1 = \\epsilon \\) indicates that the output of the channel \\( R \\) acting on \\( \\rho_{BC} \\) is close to the joint state \\( \\rho_{ABC} \\) in terms of the trace norm. The trace distance is a measure of how distinguishable two quantum states are.\n\n3. **Dependence on Dimensions and Number of Qubits**: The prefactor \\( c \\) will depend on the dimensions of the systems involved. Since we are dealing with \\( d \\)-dimensional qudits, the dimension of the Hilbert space for each subsystem will influence the amount of information that can be encoded and transmitted.\n\n4. **Scaling with Number of Qubits**: The number of qubits \\( N_A \\), \\( N_B \\), and \\( N_C \\) will also affect the conditional mutual information. More qubits generally allow for more information to be stored and processed. Therefore, we expect \\( c \\) to scale with the number of qubits in some way.\n\n5. **Combining the Effects**: Given that \\( c \\) must account for both the dimension \\( d \\) and the number of qubits \\( N_A \\), \\( N_B \\), and \\( N_C \\), we can express \\( c \\) as a function of these parameters. A reasonable assumption is that \\( c \\) scales with the total number of qubits involved, which is \\( N_A + N_B + N_C \\), and also with the dimension \\( d \\).\n\nThus, we can conclude that the prefactor \\( c \\) can be expressed as:\n\\[\nc \\sim d \\cdot (N_A + N_B + N_C)\n\\]\n\nFinal answer:\n\\[\nc \\sim d (N_A + N_B + N_C)\n\\]"]], "filtered_resps": [["c"]], "filter": "math-extract", "metrics": ["math_verify_score"], "doc_hash": "2d5a649acbeb6eb871ea5913ca2e3ec0bd96923fa5f6871c340a99b70f471381", "prompt_hash": "38e3e7c9241a2311436f362bfb7803918bbc8df16db279d05d27ab2cd9f85bfc", "target_hash": "37a142f9ce5d1c3186a5d2373ccf10f46ab564d5f9dcdff7c97375e3e032a679", "math_verify_score": 0.0}
