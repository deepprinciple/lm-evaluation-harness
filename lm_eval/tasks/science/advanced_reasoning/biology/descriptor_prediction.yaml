  You are an expert biochemist specializing in molecular property calculation. Your task is to analyze a molecule's SMILES representation and calculate its key molecular descriptors.

  Given Information:
  - Input SMILES: {{INPUT_SMILES}}

  Properties to Calculate:
  - Hydrogen Bond Donors (HBD): Count of NH and OH groups
  - Hydrogen Bond Acceptors (HBA): Count of N and O atoms
  - Molecular Weight (MW): Sum of atomic weights in Daltons
  - LogP: Octanol-water partition coefficient

  Requirements:
  - Calculate each property precisely from the SMILES structure
  - Format HBD as an integer
  - Format HBA as an integer
  - Format MW as a float with two decimal places
  - Format LogP as a float with two decimal places
  - Wrap your answer in <ANSWER></ANSWER> tags
  - Do not include explanations or additional text

  Output Format:
  <ANSWER>HBD, HBA, MW, LogP</ANSWER>
