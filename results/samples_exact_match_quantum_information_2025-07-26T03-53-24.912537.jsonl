The conditional mutual information is defined as:\n\n\\[\nI(A:C|B) = S(\\rho_{AB}) + S(\\rho_{BC}) - S(\\rho_{ABC}) - S(\\rho_B)\n\\]\n\nwhere \\( S(\\rho) \\) is the von Neumann entropy of the state \\(\\rho\\).\n\nThe problem states that there exists a channel \\( R \\) such that the trace distance between \\( R[\\rho_{BC}] \\) and \\(\\rho_{ABC}\\) is \\(\\epsilon\\). The trace distance is a measure of how distinguishable two quantum states are, and it is related to the fidelity between the states. A small trace distance implies that the states are close to each other.\n\nThe Fannes-Audenaert inequality provides a bound on the difference in von Neumann entropies of two states in terms of their trace distance. For two states \\(\\sigma\\) and \\(\\tau\\) with trace distance \\(\\delta\\), the inequality is:\n\n\\[\n|S(\\sigma) - S(\\tau)| \\le \\delta \\log d + H(\\delta)\n\\]\n\nwhere \\( H(\\delta) = -\\delta \\log \\delta - (1-\\delta) \\log (1-\\delta) \\) is the binary entropy function, and \\( d \\) is the dimension of the Hilbert space.\n\nIn our case, the dimension of the Hilbert space for the state \\(\\rho_{ABC}\\) is \\( d^{N_A + N_B + N_C} \\), and for \\(\\rho_{BC}\\), it is \\( d^{N_B + N_C} \\). The channel \\( R \\) maps from the space of \\(\\rho_{BC}\\) to \\(\\rho_{ABC}\\), and the trace distance between \\( R[\\rho_{BC}] \\) and \\(\\rho_{ABC}\\) is \\(\\epsilon\\).\n\nUsing the Fannes-Audenaert inequality, we can bound the change in entropy due to the channel \\( R \\):\n\n\\[\n|S(R[\\rho_{BC}]) - S(\\rho_{ABC})| \\le \\epsilon \\log d^{N_A + N_B + N_C} + H(\\epsilon)\n\\]\n\nSince \\(\\epsilon\\) is small, \\( H(\\epsilon) \\) is negligible, and we focus on the term involving the logarithm. The dimension \\( d^{N_A + N_B + N_C} \\) simplifies the expression to:\n\n\\[\n\\epsilon (N_A + N_B + N_C) \\log d\n\\]\n\nThe conditional mutual information \\( I(A:C|B) \\) is then bounded by the sum of these entropy differences, which are each bounded by terms involving \\(\\epsilon\\) and the dimensions of the respective spaces. Therefore, the prefactor \\( c \\) in the bound \\( I(A:C|B) \\le c \\sqrt{\\epsilon} \\) will depend on the dimensions of the spaces involved.\n\nConsidering the dimensions and the fact that the conditional mutual information involves terms from the spaces of \\( A \\), \\( B \\), and \\( C \\), the prefactor \\( c \\) will be proportional to the sum of the dimensions of these spaces, each scaled by the logarithm of the dimension \\( d \\).\n\nThus, the prefactor \\( c \\) is:\n\n\\[\nc = (N_A + N_B + N_C) \\log d\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n\\[\nc = (N_A + N_B + N_C) \\log d\n\\]"]], "filtered_resps": [["(N_A + N_B + N_C) \\log d"]], "filter": "math-extract", "metrics": ["math_verify_score"], "doc_hash": "2d5a649acbeb6eb871ea5913ca2e3ec0bd96923fa5f6871c340a99b70f471381", "prompt_hash": "38e3e7c9241a2311436f362bfb7803918bbc8df16db279d05d27ab2cd9f85bfc", "target_hash": "37a142f9ce5d1c3186a5d2373ccf10f46ab564d5f9dcdff7c97375e3e032a679", "math_verify_score": 0.0}
