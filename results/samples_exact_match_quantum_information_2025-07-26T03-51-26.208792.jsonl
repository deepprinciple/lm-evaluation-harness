Subsystems \\( A \\), \\( B \\), and \\( C \\) contain \\( N_A \\), \\( N_B \\), and \\( N_C \\) qudits, respectively. There exists a quantum channel \\( R \\) acting on the Hilbert space \\( BC \\) and outputting to \\( AB \\) such that:\n   \\[\n   \\| R[\\rho_{BC}] - \\rho_{ABC} \\|_1 = \\epsilon\n   \\]\n   \n   This condition implies that the state \\( \\rho_{ABC} \\) is close to the image of \\( \\rho_{BC} \\) under the channel \\( R \\) within a trace distance \\( \\epsilon \\).\n\n2. **Conditional Mutual Information (CMI) Bound:**\n   \n   It is stated that:\n   \\[\n   I(A:C|B) \\leq c \\cdot \\sqrt{\\epsilon}\n   \\]\n   \n   The goal is to determine how the prefactor \\( c \\) depends on the dimensions \\( d \\), and the number of qudits \\( N_A \\), \\( N_B \\), and \\( N_C \\).\n\n3. **Dependence on System Sizes and Dimensions:**\n   \n   - **Dimensionality (\\( d \\)):** The dependence on \\( d \\) typically enters logarithmically in information-theoretic quantities because mutual information and related measures often involve logarithms of dimensions.\n   \n   - **Number of Qudits (\\( N_A \\), \\( N_B \\), \\( N_C \\)):** The prefactor \\( c \\) should scale linearly with the number of qudits in subsystems \\( A \\) and \\( C \\) since they directly contribute to the correlations measured by the conditional mutual information. The subsystem \\( B \\) acts as the conditioning system, and its size can influence the recovery process but typically does not enter the prefactor in a linear manner.\n\n4. **Synthesizing the Dependencies:**\n   \n   Combining these insights, the prefactor \\( c \\) should scale proportionally with the sum of the numbers of qudits in \\( A \\) and \\( C \\), and logarithmically with the dimension \\( d \\).\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\n\\[\nc \\propto \\left(N_A + N_C\\right) \\log d\n\\]"]], "filtered_resps": [["\\]"]], "filter": "math-extract", "metrics": ["math_verify_score"], "doc_hash": "2d5a649acbeb6eb871ea5913ca2e3ec0bd96923fa5f6871c340a99b70f471381", "prompt_hash": "38e3e7c9241a2311436f362bfb7803918bbc8df16db279d05d27ab2cd9f85bfc", "target_hash": "37a142f9ce5d1c3186a5d2373ccf10f46ab564d5f9dcdff7c97375e3e032a679", "math_verify_score": 0.0}
