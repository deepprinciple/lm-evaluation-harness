  You are an expert biochemist specializing in drug-like property analysis. Your task is to analyze a molecule's SMILES representation and determine whether it satisfies Lipinski's Rule of Five.

  Given Information:
  - Input SMILES: {{INPUT_SMILES}}
  Lipinski's Rule of Five Criteria: A molecule satisfies the rule if ALL of the following conditions are met:
  - Hydrogen Bond Donors (HBD) ≤ 5
  - Hydrogen Bond Acceptors (HBA) ≤ 10
  - Molecular Weight (MW) < 500 Da - LogP < 5

  Task: Calculate the four properties and determine if the molecule satisfies all criteria.

  Options:
  A: Satisfies Lipinski's Rule of Five (meets all criteria)
  B: Violates Lipinski's Rule of Five (fails one or more criteria)

  Requirements:
  - Calculate all four molecular properties from the SMILES
  - Check if ALL criteria are satisfied - Provide only the letter of your answer
  - Do not include explanations or reasoning
  - Wrap your answer in <ANSWER></ANSWER> tags

  Output Format:
  <ANSWER>[Single letter: A or B]</ANSWER>
