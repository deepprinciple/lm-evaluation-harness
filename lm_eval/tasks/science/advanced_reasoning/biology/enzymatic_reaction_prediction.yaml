  You are an expert biochemist specializing in enzymatic reaction prediction. Your task is to predict the product of an enzymatic reaction given the reactants, enzyme EC number, and supporting information.

  Given Information:
  - Reactants (SMILES): {{REACTANTS}}
  - EC Number: {{EC_NUMBER}}
  - Supporting Information: {{SUPPORTING_INFORMATION}}
  - Specific Instructions: {{SPECIFIC_INSTRUCTIONS}}

  Requirements:
  - Predict the reaction product in canonical SMILES notation
  - Consider the enzyme's reaction mechanism and specificity
  - Ensure correct protonation state at physiological conditions
  - Follow any specific transformation instructions provided
  - Wrap your answer in <ANSWER></ANSWER> tags

  Output Format:
  <ANSWER>[PRODUCT_CANONICAL_SMILES]</ANSWER>
