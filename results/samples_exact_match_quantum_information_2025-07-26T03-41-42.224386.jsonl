It is defined as:\n   \\[\n   I(A:C|B) = S(A|B) + S(C|B) - S(A,C|B)\n   \\]\n   where \\( S(X|Y) \\) is the conditional entropy of \\( X \\) given \\( Y \\).\n\n2. **Trace Distance and Channels**: The condition \\( || R[\\rho_{BC}] - \\rho_{ABC} ||_1 = \\epsilon \\) indicates that the output of the channel \\( R \\) acting on \\( \\rho_{BC} \\) is close to the joint state \\( \\rho_{ABC} \\) in terms of the trace distance. The trace distance is a measure of how distinguishable two quantum states are.\n\n3. **Dependence on Dimensions and Number of Qubits**: The prefactor \\( c \\) will depend on the dimensions of the systems involved. Specifically:\n   - The dimension \\( d \\) of the qudits affects the capacity of the systems to encode information. Higher dimensions generally allow for more complex states and thus can influence the amount of information that can be shared or conditioned upon.\n   - The number of qudits \\( N_A \\), \\( N_B \\), and \\( N_C \\) will also affect the total dimension of the Hilbert spaces involved. The total dimension of the Hilbert space for each subsystem is \\( d^{N_A} \\), \\( d^{N_B} \\), and \\( d^{N_C} \\) respectively.\n\n4. **Bounding the Conditional Mutual Information**: The relationship between the trace distance and the conditional mutual information can be established through various inequalities in quantum information theory. Specifically, it is known that the conditional mutual information can be bounded in terms of the trace distance, and the prefactor \\( c \\) will typically scale with the dimensions of the systems involved.\n\n5. **Final Expression for \\( c \\)**: Given the above considerations, we can conclude that the prefactor \\( c \\) will depend on the dimensions \\( d \\) and the number of qudits \\( N_A \\), \\( N_B \\), and \\( N_C \\). A reasonable assumption is that \\( c \\) scales with the total dimension of the systems involved, which can be expressed as:\n   \\[\n   c \\sim d^{\\max(N_A, N_B, N_C)}\n   \\]\n\nThus, the final answer for the prefactor \\( c \\) in terms of the parameters is:\n\n\\[\nc \\sim d^{\\max(N_A, N_B, N_C)}\n\\]"]], "filtered_resps": [["I(A:C|B) = S(A|B) + S(C|B) - S(A,C|B)"]], "filter": "math-extract", "metrics": ["math_verify_score"], "doc_hash": "2d5a649acbeb6eb871ea5913ca2e3ec0bd96923fa5f6871c340a99b70f471381", "prompt_hash": "38e3e7c9241a2311436f362bfb7803918bbc8df16db279d05d27ab2cd9f85bfc", "target_hash": "37a142f9ce5d1c3186a5d2373ccf10f46ab564d5f9dcdff7c97375e3e032a679", "math_verify_score": 0.0}
