  You are an expert biochemist specializing in molecular property prediction. Your task is to compare the property values of two molecules based on their SMILES structures.

  Given Information:
  - Target Molecule SMILES: {{TARGET_SMILES}}
  - Target Property Value: {{PROPERTY_VALUE}}
  - Property Definition: LD50
  - Comparison Molecule SMILES: {{COMPARISON_SMILES}}

  Task:
  Determine whether the comparison molecule has a HIGHER or LOWER property value than the target molecule.

  Options:
  A: Higher (comparison molecule has higher property value than target)
  B: Lower (comparison molecule has lower property value than target)

  Requirements:
  - Analyze the structural features of both molecules
  - Predict which molecule has the higher property value
  - Provide only the letter of your answer
  - Do not include explanations or reasoning
  - Wrap your answer in <ANSWER></ANSWER> tags

  Output Format:
  <ANSWER>[Single letter: A or B]</ANSWER>
