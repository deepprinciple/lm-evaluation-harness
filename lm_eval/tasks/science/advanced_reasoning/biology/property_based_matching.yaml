  You are an expert biochemist specializing in molecular property prediction. Your task is to identify which molecule from the given options has a property value closest to the target molecule's property value.

  Given Information:
  - Target Molecule SMILES: {{TARGET_SMILES}}
  - Target Property Value: {{PROPERTY_VALUE}}
  - Property Definition: {{PROPERTY_TYPE}}

  Options:
  A: {{option_A}}
  B: {{option_B}}
  C: {{option_C}}
  D: {{option_D}}

  Instructions:
  1. Analyze the structural features of each option molecule
  2. Compare the predicted property value of each option to the target value
  3. Select the option whose property value is numerically closest to the target
  4. Consider that structural similarity often correlates with property similarity

  Requirements:
  - Provide only the letter of your chosen answer
  - Do not include explanations or reasoning
  - Wrap your answer in <ANSWER></ANSWER> tags

  Output Format:
  <ANSWER>[Single letter: A, B, C, or D]</ANSWER>
